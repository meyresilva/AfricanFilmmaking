Here I share some theory on African cinema as well as some works by African filmmakers.  
Films have been used to entertain, educate, retell stories and revisit the past. In *Film and the Construction of a New Past*, 
Robert Rosenstone affirms that films have been 
a medium to reinterpret the past, thus, 
historians should be more sympathetic to the 
visual media, as they open up other perspectives to
 approach the past. (Rosenstone,5)
