## Film and History

In *Film and the Construction of a New Past*, 
Robert Rosenstone affirms that films have been 
a medium to reinterpret the past, thus, 
historians should be more sympathetic to the 
visual media, as they open up other perspectives to
 approach the past. (Rosenstone,5) 
For him, African filmmakers look at historical fissures 
by challenging notions of linearity and objectivity or neutrality 
of historical research. What he calls *New History Film* 
gives room to a multiplicity of voices while bringing to light 
untold stories. Here, filmmaking utilizes many strategies and techniques
 to bring to the screen the multifaceted historical narratives, 
becoming a legitimate data to rethink and rewrite historical narratives. 

Rosenstone argues that some aspects of history
 which never had any space in children’s schoolbooks 
should appear in films, turning into an educational tool and 
an instrument of empowerment. These works often appear in communities 
where people want to make their voices heard, and are in 
“desperate need of historical connections -  postcolonial nations, 
long-established countries where political systems are in upheaval;
 societies recovering from totalitarian regimes or the horrors of the war; 
ethnic, political, social or sexual minorities involved in the search to 
recapture or create viable heritages.” (Rosenstone 1995:5)

By abandoning realism and its connection with the
 social order, and promoting new forms of representing historical
 narratives, *New History Films* diverge from traditional historical
 narratives in content and form and create new form of telling stories by 
“mixing genres, blurring the distinction between the documentary and the dramatic film.”
 (Rosenstone 1995:5)
