Also, Flame, Ingrid Sinclair’s film, a moving story that 
deals with the low status of women soldiers after the 
liberation of the country, focuses on women soldiers’ poverty and their 
exclusion from the spheres of power after the Independence of Zimbabwe. 
The process of liberation did not change women’s condition or minimize 
masculine privilege. Many debates on how women in the guerrillas were 
sexually abused and exploited during the war have been part and 
parcel of the historiography of women’s presence in the struggles
 of decolonization across the African continent.
