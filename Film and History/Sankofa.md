In Haile Sankofa, Haile Gerima, an Ethiopian filmmaker, attempts 
to restore African 
descent past through an emphasis on subjectivity and 
self-representation by dismantling the idea of enslaved 
people as voiceless and passive commodities. 
Through visual media that also permits imagination
 and reinterpretation, Gerima brings to the center of 
his narrative a different historical perspective.
