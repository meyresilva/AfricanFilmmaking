Ousmane Sembéne, a Senegalese filmmaker,
 known as the father of African cinema, also deals 
with history rewriting, as a tool to right a wrong 
and educate his people. Sembene started his career 
writing novels but thought the screen would reach a larger 
audience in Africa. Sembéne usually empowers female characters, 
deconstructs stereotypes, and defies patriarchal power, unveiling
 traditional structures that may contribute to women disempowerment. 
In Faat Kiné Sembene portrays a day of joy in the protagonist's life as
 her children celebrate the baccalaureate diploma. The flashbacks let
 us know what the protagonist had to go through until that celebration day. 
A mother who struggled to survive in a sexist environment 
where she had to face disrespect and violence,
 Sembéne's protagonist overcomes all obstacles, becoming a successful woman.
